### Kickstarter Analysis

## What makes a successful Kickstarter project?

Over two billion dollars have been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the over 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.
Since getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick to finding success. Here I organize and analyze sample projects from the May 2009 to March 2017 in order to uncover any hidden trends.
 
## Data Structure

Recently, Kickstarter released its public data repository to allow students and researchers like us to help them solve a problem. The datasets which we are planning to use is from Google data set as well as by scraping the Kickstarter website.

## What made us do this ?

We have determined that our challenge question will investigate factors of success for a Kickstarter project as follows: 
“How do KickStarter project variables impact the probability of successful funding?” 
This problem will be explored through three tiers of increasing complexity. Using this system we will be able to provide a baseline of how project success by category type differs and insight on how variables impact these categories differently. 

This insight will culminate in a prediction model for a hypothetical project. These tiers will be attempted in the following order: 
* Tier 1: Identify relationship between project category and successful funding on Kickstarter 
* Tier 2: Stratify by project category and identify predictors of success for each 
* Tier 3: Build a predictive model to determine probability of funding success given hypothetical variables (potential extension of predicting probability of cancelation after successful funding)


This project was done as a submission for our final project for Business Data Science course in Maters in IT & Management at McCombs School of Business - University of Texas as Austin. It was a team effort with other 3 members - Abraham George , Hani Noueilaty and Lovekesh Bansal.
